I remember walking into Babcock as a bright-eyed graduate with a spreadsheet of ambitions and very few answers. Eighteen months later I left with a toolbox of practical skills, a handful of improbable stories, and the odd singe mark on my soldering iron.

I finished the graduate scheme early and was quietly swept into the R&D team. Overnight the problems changed: instead of reading spec sheets I was integrating military-grade GPS units, pairing IP radios to custom localization stacks, and teaching small μUGVs how to know where they were. The challenge wasn't only technical — it was getting software and hardware to agree on what 'here' looked like.

One week I was knee-deep in PCB footprints, the next I was in a muddy field running field tests for UGVs and UAVs. Those field tests were a crucible — the kit didn't care about tidy lab conditions. It taught me to design for mess: robust power rails, sensible connectors, and error-handling that worked when the weather didn't.

I also ran workshops on Continuous Integration and Deployment. I learned to explain why automated tests matter to a room that usually talks about torque and telemetry. Turning CI/CD from an abstract ideal into a practical benefit (faster iterations, fewer burned boards) changed how teams shipped features.

Another unexpected part of the job was people. I spent a lot of time working with small and medium enterprises — suppliers, specialists, and teams with expertise we leaned on. I learned how to turn technical questions into pragmatic requirements and how to keep relationships that outlasted individual projects.

If I had to sum it up: Babcock taught me to bridge worlds. I learned to move from schematic to flight test, from a line of Rust or C to a vehicle that has to survive a field trial, and from an architecture diagram to a supplier who's actually going to deliver next Tuesday. Those are the lessons I still reach for when a problem looks like a gap between two teams.

- Roles and highlights:

- Field Test Engineer — ran UGV and UAV trials that pushed prototypes beyond the lab.
- Hardware design — created schematics and PCB layouts for power and sensor integration on μUGVs.
- Systems integration — connected telematics, radios and robotics stacks to make reliable demos.
- Workshops & mentoring — taught CI/CD and pragmatic software practices to hardware teams.

It wasn't glamorous every day, but it was honest work that taught me how systems behave when theory meets the real world — and that's the kind of experience that sticks.
