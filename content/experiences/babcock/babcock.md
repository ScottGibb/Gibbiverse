I joined Babcock as an Electronic and Electrical Graduate, after finishing my MEng at the University of Strathclyde in Computer and Electronic Systems. It involved a relocation from Glasgow to Bristol and the beginning of my career.

My first placement as an graduate engineer was the ACMS team in which I was reviewing wiring diagrams and cable management for Server Racks. I then went on to seek further oppertunities at the company, focusing on Robotics and Autonomy and this is where I reached out to Sam Duffield in the Technology, Design and Innovation Team, marking the start of my Robotics career.

## Technology Design and Innovation

The TDI team was responsible for working with small-medium enterprises. Babcock was/is primarily known to be a System Integrator as such they dont do much development of internal systems, their focus is on the development of joining lots of intellectual property from other companies. TDI's purpose was to go liase with these companies and create working business relations.

This is where I travelled the most in my career, between going to Spain, Italy, France for various conferences and meeting with various companies in the Defence industry.

### Demo Day

One of the most interesting ventures I had was the development of Micro Unmanned Ground Vehicles or uUGVs. The mission was to develop a working autonomy stack so that the team could fully understand what partners we had to integrate with and what business capabilities we needed.

This involved working with Additive manufacturing technologies such as 3D printing as well as Printed Circuit Board design with Kicad. Not only that we developed C++ integration software for our Robots to connect to the internal geolacion mapping software so that we could control these robots in the field.

### Secondment

Since I was a graduate during this time, I was fortunate enough to go on a secondment in which I worked with one of Babcocks Business partners [Digital Concepts Engineering](/experiences/digital_concepts_engineering/digital_concepts_engineering/). A truelly exciting secondment in which I successfully prototyped a Universal Robot controller.

Upon completion of the secondment I came back to Babcock and then was promoted to Robotics and Embedded Software Engineer, where I stopped my placements with the company and fully integrated to the Technology Design and Innovation Team.
