After finishing my MEng in Computer and Electronic Systems at the University of Strathclyde, I joined Babcock as an Electronic and Electrical Graduate. This meant relocating from Glasgow to Bristol and officially kicking off my engineering career.

My first placement was with the ACMS team, where I reviewed wiring diagrams and managed cabling for server racks. Eager for new challenges, I soon set my sights on Robotics and Autonomy—reaching out to [Sam Duffield](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-duffield/) and [Harry Bulman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-harry-bulman/) in the Technology, Design and Innovation Team. That move marked the real start of my robotics journey.

## Technology Design and Innovation

The TDI team focused on collaborating with small and medium enterprises. Since Babcock is primarily a system integrator, they don’t develop many internal systems—instead, their strength lies in bringing together intellectual property from a range of companies. TDI’s role was to liaise with these partners, build strong business relationships, and understand their capabilities to see how Babcock could integrate their technologies into larger solutions. This gave me the chance to work with a huge variety of companies and tech, from drone systems and unmanned ground vehicles to computer vision, positioning systems, quantum enabled encryption, and all sorts of defence-related innovations.

This was also the most travel-heavy part of my career—jetting off to Spain, Italy, France, and beyond for conferences and meetings with companies across the defence industry.

### Demo Day

One of the most fascinating projects I worked on was developing Micro Unmanned Ground Vehicles (uUGVs). Our goal was to build a working autonomy stack—not just to show off cool robotics, but to really understand which partners we’d need to integrate with and what capabilities the business required.

This meant diving into additive manufacturing with 3D printing, designing custom PCBs in KiCad, and writing C++ integration software to connect our robots to internal geolocation mapping systems—so we could actually control these machines out in the field.

### Secondment

I landed a secondment with one of Babcock's business partners, [Digital Concepts Engineering](/experiences/digital_concepts_engineering/digital_concepts_engineering/). It was an awesome experience where I successfully prototyped a Universal Robot controller capable of controlling their various robotic platforms, including tracked vehicles, wheeled vehicles such as HX60 and the Ford Ranger.

After completing the secondment, I returned to Babcock and was promoted to Robotics and Embedded Software Engineer—ending my placements and fully joining the Technology Design and Innovation Team.

From here, I went on to explore the product manufacturing space and went on to work at [Dyson](/experiences/dyson/dyson) as an Embedded Software Engineer.
