One of the earliest multidisciplinary teams I had experienced was my time in the University of Strathclyde Eco Vehicle (USEV), in which we developed an small scale electric vehicle, including custom hardware, firmware and software. One of the most exciting projects I worked on, not without its difficulties.

## The Teams

USEV stood at over 100 engineers across multiple years within the university, all focusing on different things I was apart of the Powertrain team focused on inter communications between the different electrical subsystems, however there were many more teams.

- Mechanical
- Powertrain
- Telemetry
- Battery

What I really enjoyed about this scoiety was that I worked with many engineers developing the Controller Area Network (CAN) systems for the vehicle and how the different modules would connect.
