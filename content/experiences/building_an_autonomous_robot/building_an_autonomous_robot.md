title: Building an Autonomous Robot

![Autonomous Robot](./Autonomous%20Robot.jpeg)

The internship was based around continuing my fourth-year project. The goal involved turning a radio-controlled Rampaging Chariot into an Autonomous Robot. This venture involved me developing 3D printed parts, electronic hardware, and finally building my own software in Embedded C, Python and Java. In short, a Full Stack approach was taken in developing a robotic system. During the university year, the focus was on designing and constructing hardware, with some emphasis on software and chassis development. After this was done, the direction of the internship was purely on software and small hardware changes. However, a lot of issues were discovered about the harmful effects of Electromagnetic Interference with different communications such as I2C and Wi-Fi. I did manage to fix these issues, using better grounding techniques and constructing my own Electromagnetic Shielding. The robot consisted of three main layers of software all building upon each other. The lowest level was the sensor controller firmware; its responsibility was to gather sensor data, process it and send it back to the Raspberry Pi via an I2C Connection. The next level was the Raspberry Pi python application, which controlled the motor controllers through a UART connection, as well as communicating to a variety of I2C devices. This level of software was also responsible for the central control and overall processing of the robot. Finally, the information was relayed back to a Java FX application using TCP sockets. The FX application was the highest-level software and allowed for direct open-loop and closed-loop control of the robot. Sensor Fusion algorithms were also implemented, such as the Kalman and Complimentary Filters. MATLAB was used to verify the results along with analysing the viability of the I2C communications. The project allowed me to gain a lot of knowledge and experience about Robotics and really showed me the difficulties in designing embedded systems.
