After leaving [Babcock](/experiences/babcock/babcock), I joined **Dyson** as part of the **New Product Innovation Software Team (NST)**, a multidisciplinary group working across the entire technology stack—from embedded systems and application development through to cloud services and data science. During my time in the team, I developed numerous prototypes and explored a wide range of technologies, from bare-metal microcontrollers to embedded Linux platforms.

Due to IP restrictions, I’m unable to share specific details about the prototypes, their architectures, or their intended applications. However, *watch this space*—several of these early concepts are making their way toward full product development.

## Open Source

One of my responsibilities at Dyson was helping to shape and contribute to the company’s **open-source strategy**. Working alongside highly talented engineers such as [Pete Kubiak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pete-kubiak-9252a3216/) and [James Sizeland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-sizeland-02530256/), I contributed to several Rust open-source ecosystems, including projects like [Trouble](https://github.com/embassy-rs/trouble) and [Embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy). We also developed and released a range of open-source drivers and libraries, many of which are available through the [Dyson GitHub organisation](https://github.com/dysonltd).

### Some Honourable Mentions

A few of the open-source projects I contributed to while at Dyson include:

- [Universal Robot](https://github.com/dysonltd/universal-robot): A Rust library for interfacing with Universal Robots robotic arms over TCP/IP. Hats off to [James Sizeland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-sizeland-02530256/) for leading this effort and creating a very cool library.

- [Commitment Issues](https://github.com/dysonltd/commitment-issues): A Rust library that allows compiling the metadata of Git commits into your binary at build time. This is super useful for tracking firmware versions in embedded systems. Hats off to [Pete Kubiak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pete-kubiak-9252a3216/) for spearheading this project.

- [Post Haste](https://github.com/petekubiak/post-haste): A very cool actor framework for embedded Rust, designed to simplify messaging between actors. Works both on Embassy and Tokio frameworks. Again, big thanks to [Pete Kubiak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pete-kubiak-9252a3216/) for leading this initiative.

- [TMAG5273 Driver](https://github.com/dysonltd/tmag5273): A Rust driver for the TMAG5273 magnetic sensor, A truly cross platform driver supporting systems such as MacOS, Linux, Raspberry Pi, ESP32 and STM32. Our first Rust project in Landrace.

And many, many more! You can find more of Dyson's open-source projects on the [Dyson GitHub page](https://github.com/dysonltd/). And of course, you can find my personal open-source contributions on my [Open Source page](/pages/open_source) or on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ScottGibb).

## Technical Mentorship and Line Management

During my time at Dyson, I had the opportunity to both mentor and line-manage team members—an incredibly rewarding stage in my career where I hope I built lasting connections. My responsibilities in each role are outlined below:

- **[Kaylan Ruparellia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaylan-ruparellia-619696213/) (Mentee)**  
  I supported Kaylan throughout his placement in our team, ensuring he had the tools, guidance, and opportunities needed to succeed. My focus was not only on developing his core embedded engineering skills, but also on helping him grow in the specific areas he was personally motivated to explore.

- **Tom Flaherty (Line Managed)**  
  Working with Tom was slightly different. As someone further along in his career, my role centred less on foundational skill-building and more on creating the conditions for him to thrive—ensuring he had the right environment, challenges, and direction to continue progressing.

To my **Landrace** and **Tamworth** team members: I wish you all the very best, and I hope each of you has gone on to achieve your ambitions.

After an exciting period at Dyson, I took the next step in my career and joined [Arm](/experiences/arm/arm) as an Embedded Software Engineer in the Edge IoT Solutions team.
