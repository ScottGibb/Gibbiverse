After leaving Babcock I shortly went on to join Dyson where I joined the New Production Innovation Software Team NST. A multidisciplinary team focusing on Embedded all way to the Cloud and data science. During this time I developed numerous prototypes and worked on a variety of technologies from Baremetal microcontrollers to embedded linux prototypes. Due to IP restrictions I cannot go into any details of the prototypes. But watch this space as these prototypes should hopefully turn into products soon...

## Open Source

One of the responsibilites I had whilst at Dyson was to help shape and contribute to their Open Source. I alongside some very talented Engineers (Pete Kubiak and James Sizeland), contributed to many Rust open source projects such as Trouble and Embassy, as well as creating our own Open source which can be shown on the Dyson GitHub organisation.

## Technical Mentorship and Line Management

During my time there I progressed to managing individuals alongside mentoring them a very fun and exciting time in my career where I hopefully made life long connections. My responsibilites for both are outlined belowx

- Kaylan (mentee)
  - I was responsible for Kaylan during his placement in my team, focusing on ensuring he had the right tools to succeed and ensuring that he was learning the skills needed for an embedded engineer but also the skills he wished to develop.
- Tom  (Line Managed)
  - With Tom it was slightly different in that Tom was further ahead in his career, so was less about skill development but ensuring he can be in the right place to suceed and push himself further.

To my Landrace and Tamworth team members I wish you all the best and hope that you have went on to further and complete your ambitions.
