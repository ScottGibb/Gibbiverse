I still remember my first week on the New Product Innovation Software Team (NST): a buzzing workshop full of half-built prototypes, filament dust on the benches, and a calendar full of user trials. My role quickly became one of turning ambitious ideas into tangible, testable machines. I learned to tame fleets of Dockerized devices with **Balena**, wiring them together with **MQTT** so prototypes could chat reliably during field trials, and watching a messy lab setup become a repeatable deployment was oddly satisfying.

On quieter days I’d lose myself in embedded code — open-sourcing a **Rust Embedded HAL driver** and pitching into the **Trouble Bluetooth stack** felt like leaving little gifts for the next engineer. Projects spanned the gamut of platforms: **Embedded Linux** for complex devices, bare-metal for tiny controllers, and RTOS-based builds when determinism mattered. I sketched and printed parts, iterated in CAD, and watched 3D-printed mounts go from a wobbly concept to a proud, functional piece.

One of my favorite responsibilities was building data capture rigs — thermal, depth, and visual systems that produced the ground-truth datasets the data scientists dreamed about. And beyond the hardware and code, mentoring mattered: guiding Dyson undergrads and University of Bristol students through their first risky prototypes felt like paying forward everything the team had taught me. Looking back, the work was less about any single technology and more about weaving tools, people, and messy experimentation into something reliable and useful.
