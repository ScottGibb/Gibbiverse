During my time as an Electrical Graduate I was on secondment to a small start up known as Digital Concepts Engineering. There business model was focused on retrofitting existing military vehicles and converting them into unmanned and autonomous systems. A Truelly interesting company working with multiple industries such as Health Care and Defence.

## The Task

During my time there I was tasked with the development of a Universal Robot Controller which could connect to each of their various Robots:

- HX60 - A heavy duty battle hardened Lorry for the Army
- Ford Range - A commercial off the shelf Range Rover
- X2-X4 DCEs tracked vehicle fleets

My prototype took the form of a multi microcontroller system, running STM32 series microcontroller. Which allowed low latency connection to the systems and allowed me to connect to each Robot and handle the controls dynamically.

## Italy and more Field Trips

During my time there I was also flown out to Italy to work with one of their customers, a great experience trialling their unmmaned vehicles and seeing the team in action. Also managed to go many battle conferences and review the current technology within the Defence space.
