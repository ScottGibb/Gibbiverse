So far in my life I have been fortunate enough to have had a variety of experiences and locations. I grew up in Scotland, studied Computer and Electronic Systems at the University of Strathclyde, and have worked in various roles in the tech industry.

### University

During University I worked on an electric vehicle in the University of Strathclyde Eco Vehicle(USEV) Society. It was a great time in my life and involved learning a lot about CAN Bus and my first real experience of Distributed Microcontroller systems.

I also worked at the University both as a Research Intern within the Security space and as an Engineer carrying on my Fourth Year Project

#### Digital Concepts Engineering

Whilst in Babcock I secured a Secondment with one of Babcocks partners. Digital Concepts Engineering where I worked on a Universal Robot Controller and controlled each of their robotic platforms.

#### Babcock International

After my secondment I went back to Babcock and finished the graduate scheme early and Became an Embedded Software and Robotics Engineer. Where I carried on working with Small to Medium Enterprises and working within the Defence Autonomy space.
