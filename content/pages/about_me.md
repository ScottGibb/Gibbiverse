## Who Am I?

![Scott Gibb](/images/experiences/dce/ghost_robotics.jpeg)

Hi, I'm Scott Gibb, a Computer and Electronics Engineer with a knack for designing and building cool stuff. My passions include 3D printing, electronics, programming, and pretty much anything tech-related.

Currently, I'm working as an Embedded Software Engineer at Arm, based in Cambridge, UK.

## Where Have I Been?

I've been lucky enough to rack up a variety of experiences and locations. I grew up in Scotland, studied Computer and Electronic Systems at the University of Strathclyde, and have worked in several roles across the tech industry and the United Kingdom.

### University

During my time at Strathclyde, I joined the [Eco Vehicle Society (USEV)](/experiences/usev/usev), where I got hands-on with electric vehicles, CAN Bus systems, and distributed microcontrollers. I also worked as a Research Intern in Robotic Security for the [Carnegie Trust](/experiences/developing_robotic_systems_with_security_in_mind/developing_robotic_systems_with_security_in_mind/) and continued my [Fourth Year Project](/experiences/building_an_autonomous_robot/building_an_autonomous_robot/) ( Building An Autonomous Robot) as a paid internship during the summer.

### Industry

Graduated in 2021... right in the middle of Covid. Great timing, right? Anyway, I moved to Bristol to kick off my career.

#### Babcock International

I started at [Babcock International](/experiences/babcock/babcock) as an Electrical Engineering Graduate, exploring everything from server racks and wiring to autonomous robotic systems in the Technology Design and Innovation Team.

#### Digital Concepts Engineering

While at Babcock, I landed a secondment with [Digital Concepts Engineering](/experiences/digital_concepts_engineering/digital_concepts_engineering), where I developed a Universal Robot Controller and got to control some seriously cool robotic platforms, including tracked robots and quadrupeds.

#### Back to Babcock

After my secondment, I returned to [Babcock](/experiences/babcock/babcock), wrapped up the graduate scheme early, and became an Embedded Software and Robotics Engineer. I worked with small to medium enterprises and dove into the Defence Autonomy space, going to events across the world such as EuroSatory in Paris, Italy for Autonomous Vehicles testing, and the UK Defence Battle Lab.

#### Dyson

Next stop: [Dyson](/experiences/dyson/dyson)! I jumped into the commercial world, building high-fidelity prototypes with some brilliant engineers and contributing to open-source projects, especially in IoT and Rust. This is where I really honed my skills in rapid prototyping and product development and the Rust ecosystem, contributing to several open-source projects such as Embassy, Post-haste, and others, you can checkout my [open source projects](/pages/open_source) or on my [GitHub](https://github.com/scottgibb).

## Where am I Now?

### Arm

My latest adventure has taken me to Arm in Cambridge, working with the Edge IoT Solutions Team. Stay tuned for more updates on what I'm building next!
