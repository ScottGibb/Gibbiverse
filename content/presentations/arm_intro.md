When I joined Arm as an Embedded Software Engineer. I did a short introduction presentation about myself to the team. Here are the slides from that presentation. It mainly covers content from my hobbies such as running and tough mudder and a few honourables mentions such as my time as intern at the University of Strathclyde and of course my first Robotics project WALL-E.
