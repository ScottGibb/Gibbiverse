When I joined Arm as an Embedded Software Engineer, I kicked things off with a quick introduction presentation for the team. Here are the slides I shared, featuring a mix of my hobbies (like running and Tough Mudder), a few honourable mentions from my time as an intern at the University of Strathclyde, and of course, my very first robotics project: WALL-E. You might even spot a much younger me in there too!
