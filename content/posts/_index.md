Welcome to my collection of posts! Dive in and explore articles on everything from 3D printing and modelling, embedded prototyping with PCBs, breadboards, and building things of all shapes and sizes, to writing workflows in Obsidian, crafting software (especially in Rust), and the occasional software engineering deep-dive. If you like making, tinkering, or just reading about creative projects, you’re in the right place. Hopefully someone, somewhere finds them useful (or at least entertaining)!
