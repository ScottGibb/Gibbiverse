In this first part of the series, we will focus on working with the Embedded HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) and Embedded Hal Async for our Rust driver. The Embedded HAL provides a set of traits that allow us to write platform-agnostic code, making it easier to support multiple hardware platforms.
